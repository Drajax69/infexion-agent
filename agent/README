Where to start
- Go board and write functions:
    - possible_moves_pruned()
- Ways to make it more efficient:
    - Use of BitBoards/Some other type of representation of the Board


End of tomorrow tasks:
 - Make code faster || Test my_agent vs minimax_TL and we both try to improve ours
 - Run it against Gradescope and have it submission ready
 - minimax_TL needs to use my Board()
