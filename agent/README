End of tomorrow tasks:
    - Finish a bit of the report: Amri
    - Clean up min_max_strat2 function: Amri
    - Rename files so that Gradescope accepts them: Luoti
    - Add team.py file to folder: Luoti
    - Delete unnecessary files: Luoti
    - Test min_max_strat in cases such as:------->Luoti
        - Does it work for both Blue and Red?
        - Does it win against minmax of degree 2, if playing against itself
        - Can we use degree 4?
        - Anything else you can thing of

Enhancements(AMRI):
    - Dynamic depth: Depending on number of moves //  How much time/resources is being taken
    - Presorting moves
    - Dynamic Time upperbound

    - BitBoard representation instead of dictionary (DID NOT DO IT)
    

    Problems
    - Is depth 4 worth it?
